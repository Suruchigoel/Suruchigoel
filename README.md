This HTML and CSS code I've shared creates a simple yet stylish landing page for a travel agency.
HTML Structure:
The HTML structure begins with the usual declarations, specifying the language and character set.
Within the <head> section, there are meta tags for character set and viewport settings, along with the title of the page.
The <body> contains the main content of the page.
Inside the <header>, there's a <nav> section containing the navigation links for the website and a call-to-action button for registration.
The <section> inside the <header> holds the header text, including a tagline, the agency name, and a call-to-action button to book tickets.
CSS Styles:
The CSS begins with a universal selector setting padding, margin, and box-sizing.
header section takes up the entire viewport height, displaying a background image with a gradient overlay.
nav contains the logo, navigation links, and the registration link, styled with flexbox for alignment.
Navigation links have a hover effect (expanding underline) using pseudo-elements.
The registration link has a transition effect on hover, changing background color and border.
The .h-txt section positions the header text in the center and styles the tagline, agency name, and the call-to-action button.
Key Elements:
Navigation: Offers various sections such as "HOME," "HILL STATION," "BEST OFFER," etc.
Tagline & Agency Name: Positioned at the center of the header section, emphasizing the international travel agency's tagline.
Call-to-Action: Encourages users to "BOOK YOUR TICKET" with a prominent button.
This code provides a solid foundation for a landing page. You can further expand it by adding sections for specific destinations, showcasing images, providing more detailed information, or integrating interactive elements like a search function or booking form to enhance user engagement.
